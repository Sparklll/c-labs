perform the following actions:

1. Enter the weight of the cargo (tons).
2. Enter the transportation distance (km).
3. Data analysis and the conclusion of the decision to accept the order.
4. Calculation and output of order parameters (calculated in case of
acceptance of the order) - the required number of machines, cost
insurance, the total cost of the transportation order.
