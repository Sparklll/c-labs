# Task 6.2 (5)

```
The "B-Project" program is a simplified version of the "MS Project"
product that allows you to manage the project. Each project consists
of jobs that can be completed sequentially or in parallel. The job has
a start date and the end. People can be assigned to the project to work
on it. Resources may also be allocated to the project. The program calculates
project timeline, resources, defines a critical path and tasks that can be
performed in parallel, time limit for completing jobs.
